      <title>Learning about InterMine</title>
      <link>http://intermine.org/contributing/learning/</link>

      <description>Welcome! We&amp;rsquo;re excited to have you join the community. InterMine integrates biological data, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a biologist to contribute to InterMine. Some of our entry-level issues only require knowledge of the relevant programming language, but others may require more in-depth understanding.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn a bit more about InterMine, we have a nice 5 minute video for you to sum things up:
 If you prefer textual learning resources, you could look at the InterMine documentation for a technical overview of InterMine&amp;rsquo;s server, the FlyMine tutorials for a biologist/bioinformatician oriented overview, or you could hop straight into our Python tutorials to learn more about querying our data model.</description>

      <description>Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve never made a pull request before, or you&amp;rsquo;ve used git a little but never collaboratively? Have a look through the open source guide to submitting contributions to give you a good idea of how things work.
Some of our issues are marked first-timers-only - these are issues that may be relatively straightforward, where we&amp;rsquo;ll happily walk you through steps you&amp;rsquo;re unsure about. (psst, you can also search GitHub for all issues marked with this label, not just InterMine).</description>
